## **SHORT FILM PIPELINE**

This pipeline is to build for a brand new studio. Base on the package: "Maya, Mari, Nuke, ZBrush, Hounidi and Adobe"

Currently, I am working in Windows 10, Maya 2017, Mari, Houdini, Nuke and Adobe Photoshop.

Regarding to VFX Reference Platform, due to large invention we will stay with python 2.7 but will update to python 3 on 2019.
Details is here:

To run it you need to install Python standalone, so I use Anaconda python 2.7 which is very useful.
You can download Anaconda installer here:

Right now, most of my work is focusing on developing for Maya, I will work on others in near future.

For Maya plugin required:

    Vray 3.6
