## **SHORT FILM PIPELINE**

This pipeline is to build for a brand new studio. Base on the package: "Maya, Mari, Nuke, ZBrush, Hounidi and Adobe"

Currently, I am working in Windows, Maya 2017, Mari 3.3, Houdini 16, Nuke 11 and Adobe CC.

Regarding to VFX Reference Platform, due to large invention on python 2.7, we will stay in python 2.7. I recommend using Anaconda because it contains modules as required.

It requires Python standalone, so I use Anaconda python 2.7 which is very useful.

Right now, most of my work is focusing on developing for Maya, I will work on others in near future.

For Maya plugin required:

    Vray 3.6
